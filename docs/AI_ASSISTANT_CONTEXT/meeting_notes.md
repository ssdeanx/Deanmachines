# Meeting Notes & Conversation History

## Current Session - Repository Analysis & Upstash Integration

### Date: [Current Session]
### Topic: DeanMachines-RSC Repository Analysis & Upstash Integration Deep Dive

#### Key Discussion Points:

1. **Repository Overview Completed**
   - Analyzed both `/src/app` (frontend) and `/src/mastra` (AI backend)
   - Identified Next.js 15 + React 19 frontend with CopilotKit integration
   - Discovered 22+ specialized agents with comprehensive tool ecosystem
   - Mapped out workflow orchestration and agent networks

2. **Upstash Integration Analysis**
   - **Upstash Redis**: Distributed memory, conversation storage, session management
   - **Upstash Vector**: 384-dim semantic search with fastembed embeddings
   - **Upstash Logging**: Dual logging system (PinoLogger + Upstash distributed logs)
   - **Environment**: 4 required environment variables identified

3. **Key Findings**:
   - Extensive integration across all 22+ agents
   - Advanced memory processors (AttentionGuidedMemoryProcessor, ContextualRelevanceProcessor)
   - Comprehensive vector operations with MongoDB-style filtering
   - Performance monitoring and real-time log aggregation
   - Serverless-first architecture optimized for global distribution

4. **Documentation Created**:
   - `docs/UPSTASH_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive technical analysis
   - `docs/AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT/user_preferences.md` - User context and preferences
   - Current file: Meeting notes for conversation continuity

#### Action Items:
- [x] Create project overview documentation
- [x] Document specific implementation patterns
- [ ] Create setup guides for different deployment scenarios
- [ ] Analyze specific agent implementations in detail
- [ ] **NEW**: Set up MCP tools access for AI assistant

#### Current Focus:
- **External MCP Tools**: User is working on providing external MCP server access
- Tools like fetch, git, GitHub, Brave, etc. for assistant capabilities
- This will enable real-time testing, validation, and hands-on exploration
- Will complement the DeanMachines analysis with practical implementation

#### Next Session Topics:
- Deep dive into specific agents (Master, Research, Code agents)
- Upstash setup and configuration optimization
- Performance tuning and monitoring strategies
- Advanced vector search implementations
- Agent coordination patterns
